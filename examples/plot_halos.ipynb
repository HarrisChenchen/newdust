    "# How to compute the surface brightness profile for a dust scattering halo\n",
    "\n",
    "The `newdust.halos` module can compute the surface brightness profile for a dust scattering halo under a variety of geometric assumptions. This functionality is provided by two main subclasses of the `newdust.halos.Halo` superclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `newdust.halos.UniformGalHalo` assumes that the dust is distributed uniformly between the telescope and the X-ray point source\n",
    "\n",
    "* `newdust.halos.ScreenGalHalo` assumes that the dust is located at an infinitesimally thin screen at the location $x = (1 - d/D)$ where $d$ is the distance between the telescope and the screen, and $D$ is the distance between the telescope and the X-ray point source\n",
    "\n",
    "Through inheritance, all halos have the same attributes as those defined in the `newdust.halos.Halo` class. This notebook demonstrates the functionality of a subset of these attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `lam` array describing the energy or wavelength grid for the halo\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `theta` array describing the angular grid for the halo\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `calculate` method that takes a `newdust.GrainPop` object and any other arguments necessary to complete the calculation (such as $x$, for a ScreenGalHalo). The results are stored in the `norm_int` and `taux` arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A 2D `norm_int` array of shape `(len(lam), len(theta))` that describes the normalized intensity (intensity divided by flux) for the dust scattring halos, as a function of energy or wavelength\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `taux` array describing the X-ray scattering opacity as a function of energy or wavelength\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `calculate_intensity` method that takes the flux spectrum of the X-ray point source as input. It multiplies the flux values by the `norm_int` array and sums them, storing the final results in the `intensity`, `fabs`, and `fhalo` attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A 1D `intensity` array describing the dust scattering halo surface brightness (e.g., photon/s/cm^2/arcsec^2) integrated over the entire energy/wavelength range\n",
    "\n",
    "* The X-ray point source flux spectrum for the intensity calculation is stored in the `fabs` array. There are some subtleties around the way this is computed and stored based on the input flux spectrum for `calculate_intensity`, but don't worry about it for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `fhalo` array describes the total flux contained in the scattering halo as a function of energy or wavelength."
